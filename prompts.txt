You are a senior frontend developer with extensive experience in creating modern, responsive, and visually appealing web interfaces. Your task is to build the complete frontend for a website that focuses on astrology, numerology, tarot, and dream interpretation. The design should convey a mystical, welcoming, and professional atmosphere. The website must integrate with the AI Groq service to generate dynamic, professional-quality responses to user queries.  Requirements:  Overall Design:  Use a clean, modern layout with a visually appealing color palette that reflects the mystical aspects of astrology, tarot, numerology, and dreams.  The design should be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  Implement accessible typography, intuitive navigation, and subtle animations for added engagement.  Structure and Navigation:  Include a header/navigation bar with links to the main sections: Home, Astrology, Numerology, Tarot, and Dreams.  Create a homepage that introduces the website and briefly explains each area.  Design dedicated sections/pages for each topic with clear headings, imagery or icons, and space to display AI-generated content.  Integration with AI Groq:  Integrate the AI Groq API to fetch and display dynamic, context-sensitive professional responses when users submit queries (for example, an astrology chart reading, numerology life path calculation, tarot card interpretation, or dream analysis).  Ensure error handling and smooth loading states for a seamless user experience.  Use asynchronous data fetching (AJAX, fetch API, or a suitable frameworkâ€™s equivalent) to update content on the page without requiring a full reload.  Technical Guidelines:  Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a modern framework like React, Vue, or Angular if preferred) to develop the site.  Write clean, modular, and well-commented code to explain design choices and functionality.  Optimize for performance and SEO best practices.  Additional Considerations:  Incorporate interactive elements (e.g., sliders, accordions, or modal windows) to enrich the user experience.  Provide fallback content or messages in case the AI Groq API is unavailable.  Ensure the site adheres to modern accessibility standards.  Your final output should include the complete frontend code along with detailed comments and instructions on how to connect to the AI Groq API. Create a professional, engaging, and mystical online presence that invites users to explore the realms of astrology, numerology, tarot, and dream interpretation.
